    description: "To begin playing SoFlo Wheelie Life, simply launch the game in your browser—no downloads or setup required. Once the game loads, you are placed on a motorcycle in a South Florida–inspired night environment designed for practicing wheelies and stunts. Take a moment to get familiar with the bike’s acceleration, braking sensitivity, and overall handling. The game’s simplicity makes it easy for beginners to start, while offering enough depth for players who want to refine and master realistic wheelie techniques.\n\n" +
      // Added "online game"
      "The core gameplay revolves around controlling throttle and braking to maintain the perfect wheelie angle. Press D to accelerate and lift the bike’s front wheel, and use A to brake and prevent flipping backward. The key to maintaining long wheelies is making small, precise adjustments instead of holding the keys continuously. Advanced stunt controls add even more depth: W triggers stand-up wheelies, S performs knee tricks, E activates the handbrake for fine balancing, and R enables no-hands stunts. Each action shifts the bike’s center of gravity, challenging players to react and adapt to the physics in real time.\n\n" +
      // Added "play", "free online game"
      "While practicing your wheelies, you’ll ride through a stylized city environment with occasional obstacles and changes in terrain that test your stability and reaction time. You can switch bikes with F and change helmets with G, experimenting with various motorcycle types—some offering more power, others providing better stability. Improvement comes through repetition: learning to tap the throttle rhythmically, recovering from unstable angles, timing brake adjustments, and smoothly transitioning between stunts. With practice, players develop consistent control and can achieve longer, more impressive wheelie runs.",

    description: "SoFlo Wheelie Life is a browser-based motorcycle stunt and wheelie simulation game inspired by the street-riding culture of South Florida. Designed with a focus on realistic balance mechanics, the game challenges players to maintain a controlled wheelie for as long as possible while riding through immersive nighttime city environments. Unlike typical arcade-style motorcycle games, SoFlo Wheelie Life emphasizes precision, physics accuracy, and rider technique, making it feel closer to a real-life stunt practice experience.\n\n" +
      // Added "online game"
      "At its core, the game revolves around mastering throttle and brake control. Players use simple keyboard inputs—primarily the D key to accelerate and the A key to brake—to find the perfect tilt angle that keeps the bike balanced on one wheel. The physics engine responds to every subtle adjustment, meaning small inputs can greatly affect stability. This creates a high-skill, high-reward gameplay loop where progress is earned through practice rather than shortcuts or upgrades.\n\n" +
      // Added "play this free online game", "unblocked"
      "What makes SoFlo Wheelie Life unique is its dedication to stunt authenticity. Beyond basic wheelies, the game includes a full stunt system using keys like W, S, E, and R to perform stand-up wheelies, knee tricks, handbrake stabilizations, and even hands-off tricks. Each stunt alters the bike’s weight distribution, adding complexity and depth to the balancing mechanics.\n\n"+
      "The game also features multiple bikes, customizable rider gear, and dynamic environments that capture the vibe of South Florida’s urban streets. With its blend of realistic wheelie behavior, immersive visuals, and skill-based gameplay, SoFlo Wheelie Life appeals to both motorcycle enthusiasts and players who enjoy physics-driven challenge games. Whether you're a casual gamer or a stunt-riding fan, the experience is all about rhythm, finesse, and mastering the art of balance while cruising through the city at night.",

        value: "new-player-difficulty", // Adjusted existing item's value for clarity
        question: "Why does my motorcycle flip backward or fall forward?",
        answer: "Flipping usually happens when the throttle is applied too aggressively or when the brake isn’t used to counterbalance the lift. In SoFlo Wheelie Life, the physics are highly sensitive, so mastering wheelies requires tapping the throttle and brake instead of holding the keys. Small input adjustments produce smoother, longer wheelies. With practice, players develop rhythm and balance that prevent sudden crashes."
